# Green Impact Shopping
This project is my submission for the Visa Climate Tech Hackathon 2024. I utilized Django for the backend and React for the frontend. The web app takes the name of the store, the amount spent at that store, the date you visited that store, and the products you bought from that store as the input. These inputs are passed to the Gemini api in my backend which checks if the purchase was an environmentally good purchase or an environmentally bad purchase. The appropriate webpage is then displayed according to the result.
